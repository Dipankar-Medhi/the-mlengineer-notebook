Mean of the sample distribution mean, gives the [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]].

- CLT allows us to perform tests, solve problems and make inferences using Normal distribution even when the population is not normally distributed.

- say we take sample size of N = 3, and 1000 samples from a population.
- for each 1000 samples of 3 we find the avg. So there will 1000 avgs. (this set is sampling distribution, and ilt will approach a normal distribution as the sample size N increases)
- N increase, Normal distribution more
