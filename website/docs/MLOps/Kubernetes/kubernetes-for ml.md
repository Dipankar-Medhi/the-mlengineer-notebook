## Problems Kubernetes addresses 
- Manages volume lifecycle.
- Allow complex data transformation accross clusters.
- Provide elasticity, i.e easy scale up and down.
- Allow team to share clusters.
- Easy deployment and control of workloads.
- A single physical k8 cluster can be partitioned into multiple virtual clusters using `namespace` feature of K8.
