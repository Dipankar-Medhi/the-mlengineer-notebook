YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular state-of-the-art **object detection** system/model.

YOLO is extremely fast. It can process images at 45 Frames Per Second (FPS).

## Yolo Architecture
The architecture of YOLO is very much similar to [GoogLeNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf). It has 24 convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers.
