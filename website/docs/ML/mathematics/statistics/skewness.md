title: Skewness
---

Skewness is a measure of asymmetry that indicates whether the observations in a dataset are concentrated on one side.

:::info Formula
***Skewness*** = $\frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar x)^3}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar x)^2}^{3}}$ = $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar x)^{3}}{(n - 1)\times \sigma^{3}}$
:::

### Right(Positive) Skewed

Outliers are to the right (long tail to the right).

### Left(Negative) Skewed

Outliers are to the left.
