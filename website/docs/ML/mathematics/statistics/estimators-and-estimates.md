## Estimate

### Point estimates

- It is a single number
- It is located exactly at the middle of confidence interval.

:::tip
sample mean **x̄** is a estimator of population mean **μ**.
:::

### Unbiased estimator

:::info Formula
Expected value = Population parameter > ***sample mean*** *x̄* = ***population mean*** *μ*.
:::

### Bias estimate

:::info Formula
sample mean x̄ +1ft = population mean μ. where, 1ft = bias
:::

### Efficiency

- The most efficient estimator is unbiased estimator with smallest [[Variance and Standard Deviaiton#Variance|variance]].
