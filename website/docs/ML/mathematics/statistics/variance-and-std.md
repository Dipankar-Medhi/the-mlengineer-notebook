## Variance



Variance measures the dispersion of a set of data points around their mean. 

:::info Formula
***Population variance*** = *σ*2 = $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i-\mu)^2}{N}$ > ***Sample variance*** = *S*2 = $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar x)^2}{n-1}$

Reson foar squaring - distance cannot be negative(-ve).

It amplifies the effect of large differences.

## Standard Deviation

:::info Formula 
***Population Standard deviation*** $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$ > ***Sample standard deviation*** $S = \sqrt{S^2}$
:::

### Coefficient of Variation (*Cv*)

*Coefficient of variation* (also known as Relative standard deviation) = $\frac{Standard deviation}{mean}$ 
:::info Formual
 ***Population formula*** *Cv* = $\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$ 
 
***Sample formula*** *Ĉv* = $\frac{S}{\bar x}$

- To compare if two or more datasets have the same or different standard deviation.
- For example, if the deviation of pizza price in $ and Pesos are same or different.
- The std may be different, but coef of variation is same - this proves that the two dataset have same variability.
