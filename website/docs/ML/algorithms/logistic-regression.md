The threshold values help probabilities to define the output either 0 or 1. Values above the threshold is 1 and 0 if its below the threshold.

## Types of Logistic Regression
1. Binomial - two possible types, 0 or 1, Yes or No, etc.
2. Multinomial - 3 or more unordered types of variable.
3. Ordinal - 3 or more ordered types of dependent variables.
