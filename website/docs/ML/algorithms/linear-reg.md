## Simple Linear Regression

A target variable is influenced by an input variable.

- The **input or predictor variable** is the variable that helps predict the value of the output variable. It is commonly referred to as **X**.

- The **output or target variable** is the variable that we want to predict. It is commonly referred to as **y**.

- $\beta_o$ is the intercept that show where the line crosses the y axis.

- $\beta_1$ determines the slope of estimated regressoin line.
- And the random error $\epsilon$ is the disturbances of the model.

## Muliple Linear Regression
Here, there are two or more number of predictors of input variables.

:::caution
Having more features might improve the fit of the model to the data, but doesn't actually mean anything useful
