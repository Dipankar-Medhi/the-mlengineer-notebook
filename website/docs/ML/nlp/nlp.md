### Common task of NLP
- Lexical analysis: It divides a whole chunk of text into paragraphs, sentences,
and words, through identifying and analyzing words’ structure.
- Syntactic analysis: This involves the analysis of words in a sentence for
grammar and arranging words in a manner that shows the relationship
among the words.
- Semantic analysis: This extracts the language-independent
meaning
from the text.
- Disclosure analysis: Disclosure integration takes into account the context
of the text. It considers the meaning of the sentence before it ends. For
example: “He works at Google.” In this sentence, “he” must be referenced
in the sentence before it.
- Pragmatic analysis: Pragmatic analysis deals with overall communication
and interpretation of language. It deals with deriving meaningful
use of language in various situations.

### Popular NLP libraries
