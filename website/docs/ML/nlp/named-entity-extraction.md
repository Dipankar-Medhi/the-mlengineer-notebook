An important part of NLP is **Information Extraction**. 

## Information Extraction

A sentence may contain several words or named entities of various types like geographic, organizations, people, political, etc. or sometimes relationships between different entities in a sentence. 

Extracting information from text of a sentence/statement can help a *chatbot* train itself and make informed decisions or inferences about the world.

So, Information Extraction is converting unstructured text into structured information stored in a knowledge base or knowledge graph.

It is a part of an area called **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**

## Some information that is worth extracting
- Location
- Dates
- Numerical values
- Prices
- Addresses
